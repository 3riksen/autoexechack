#Permanent camera details

The famous .txt file tip, that when the SD card is formatted it goes away.

**ONLY COMPATIBLE WITH H3B/H3+B**

###How to install:

Download the autoexec.ash file and put it INSIDE THE DCIM folder, download the tcp_tuner.sh file and put it in the root of the SD card, download the IF_FOUND.txt file, edit it with your details, and put it in the DCIM folder.

Also, download a firmware from http://gopro.com/update and install it in the SD card.

Turn the camera ON, wait for the firmware to install and format the SD card!

Then, you just got a permanent file: EVERY TIME THE CAM TURNS ON IT MAKES THE FILE!!

A thief cannot remove the file because: if the SD card is formatted, the card wont go, if the camera is updated the file wont go too!

Also pls tether the camera.
