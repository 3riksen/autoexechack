#Permanent camera details

The famous .txt file tip, that when the SD card is formatted it goes away.

**ONLY COMPATIBLE WITH H3B/H3+B**

###How to install:

Download the autoexec.ash file and put it INSIDE THE DCIM folder, download the tcp_tuner.sh file and put it in the root of the SD card, download the IF_FOUND.txt file, edit it with your details, and put it in the DCIM folder, go to installer folder, download autoexec.ash file and put it in the root of the SD card.

Turn the camera ON, wait for the front LED to shine for5 seconds and format the SD card, then turn the camera OFF and ON again! Check the IF_FOUND.txt file is in the SD card!!

Then, you just got a permanent file: EVERY TIME THE CAM TURNS ON IT MAKES THE FILE!!

A thief cannot remove the file because: if the SD card is formatted, the file wont go, if the camera is updated the file wont go too!

Also pls tether the camera.
