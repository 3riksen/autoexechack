#Looping Video for the HERO 2014

Whether you want to use it as a dash cam to film some russian adventures or record the longest ski run, this hack will allow you to use the feature only found in the HERO3Black/HERO3+Black/HERO4 directly in your 129$ GoPro HERO.

Choose the duration you want, click a folder, click autoexec.ash, right click on RAW, choose SAVE AS, save as in the root of the SD card where DCIM and MISC are. Turn it on and it acts like in Quick Capture, it will start recording looping videos. Perfect for Dash cam.

With the new functionality, the previous clips will be stored in appropriate folders in DCIM.
For the two minute script, 4 clips are saved in the "loop"
For the five minute script, 3 clips are saved in the "loop"
For the tem minute script, 2 clips are saved in the "loop"
This is for speed, during the period of time when files are being moved, no filming occors, so this is an effort to keep that time minimal.
