#HDR on the GoPro HERO4 camera

#####FW v3

The new camera supports Protune 2.0 in photo mode, the Protune 2.0 now features EV compensation (-2.0,-1.5,-1.0,-0.5,0,0.5,1.0,1.5,2.0). Unrotunately it does not include a HDR feature for bracketing.

###How to

The hack contains two variables, **HIGHEXP** and **LOWEXP**, Replace **HIGHEXP** by a positive value: 2.0/1.5/1.0/0.5 and replace **LOWEXP** by a negative value: -2.0/-1.5/-1.0/-0.5

Then just save the hack in the SD card, turn the camera on and ut will automatically start shooting 3 pictures. Use a tripod or a mount!
